# Booking Angular App

## Introduction
This is a project written entirely by me with the purpose of presenting the skills I have on the "Angular" platform. For this purpose, I have used a minimal amount of additional libraries. Please do not abuse the code in this repositories!

The application is an application for publishing and saving places to spend the night on the occasion of a holiday or business trip.

## Startup
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Application structure

Ð¢he application contains one main and four minor modules.Each of the modules has its own service and router and components.

Accordingly, the file structure of the application is:

* App module
    * Core module.
    * Featyre.
        * Places module.
        * Users module.
    * Shared module.
    * Guards.
    * Interseptors.
    * Store. 
    * Types. 



## Modules 

1. [App module](#app-module)
2. [Core module](#core-module)
3. [Place module](#place-module)
4. [User module](#user-module)
5. [Shared module](#shared-module)

## App module
 ### Functionalities 
The app module is an entry point to the application, the main route and store are initialized through it.

### Components 

#### App component 
The App component depends on UserService , Router, OnInit ,OnDestroy.

It checks through the services whether there is any information saved in LocalStorage when the application is initialized, and if there is, it is saved with the store.

On destroy all subscription is unsubsribe.

### Router 

The router app initializes the home path and conducts the rest of the routers.
