# Booking ExpressJS service RestAPI

## Introduction

This is a project written entirely by me with the purpose of presenting the skills I have on the ExpressJS and NodeJS. For this purpose, I have used a minimal amount of additional libraries. Please do not abuse the code in this repositories!

The application is designed to serve the [Anguilla Booking App](https://github.com/StefanIliev0/booking-angular-app).
