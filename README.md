# BookingAngularApp

## Introduction
This is a project written entirely by me with the purpose of presenting the skills I have on the "Angular" platform. For this purpose, I have used a minimal amount of additional libraries.Please do not abuse the code in this repositories!

The application is an application for publishing and saving places to spend the night on the occasion of a holiday or business trip.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
