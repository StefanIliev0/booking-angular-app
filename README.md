This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Application structure

Ð¢he application contains one main and four minor modules.Each of the modules has its own service and router and components.

Accordingly, the file structure of the application is:

* App module
    * Core module.
    * Featyre.
        * Places module.
        * Users module.
    * Shared module.
    * Guards.
    * Interseptors.
    * Store. 
    * Types. 



## Modules
